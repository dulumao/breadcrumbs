# BreadCrumbs Server 
A RESTful HTTP server which allows users to generate and receive location based notes.

The server will validate and attempt to fix mobile numbers before storing. 
Upon storing a batch of numbers, the service will return some basic information about the numbers stored.

## The App 
This server is intended to support an application that Josh Kempy and I envisioned. The app would be an implementation of next generation social networking â€“ dynamic geo based interaction.

The idea would allow users to generate and receive location based data. The user need not be connected to another user to recieve data -- only to be in the place the data was dropped. This data could be as simple as a note, image, or video. As a first step, I am planning to build an API to support such an app.
